## New Branch Workflow:

### 1. Create new branch for each new feature you work on
    a. Checkout develop branch with "git checkout develop"
    b. Create new branch from master with "git checkout -b 'feature/<new-branch-name>'" or 'bug/<new-branch-name>'
    c. Add changes
    d. Commit `git commit -m "message"`
    e. Push `git push`
    
### 2. Creating Pull Requests
To learn, check out the [How to Create Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request).

## Available Scripts

### `npm run prod`
